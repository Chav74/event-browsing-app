/*This component is used to filter events based on various criteria in the event browsing app.
This page should provide filter controls that allow users to narrow down the list of events based on 
criteria like category, date range, location, or capacity. It should display a simple interface with 
inputs such as dropdowns, checkboxes, or date pickers, and when a user changes any filter, the component 
updates the visible events accordingly by passing the selected filter values back to the event list component 
through props or context.*/
