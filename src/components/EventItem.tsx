/* This component represents a single event item in the event browsing app.
This page should render a single event card that shows the most important details about an event, 
such as the title, date, location, and a short description. It should also include buttons or icons for 
actions like liking the event or RSVPing, which trigger updates through the shared event context (useEvents). 
When the title (or a “View details” link) is clicked, the user should be taken to that event’s full detail page. 
Styling should make each card easy to scan quickly, with clear hierarchy and consistent layout.*/
