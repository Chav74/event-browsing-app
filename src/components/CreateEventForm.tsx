/*this form is used to create a new event, it is used in the component/CreateEvent.tsx file.
This page should display a form that lets a user create a new event by filling in details such as title, 
description, date and time, location, category, and optional fields like capacity or image URL. 
When the form is submitted, it should validate the inputs, generate a new event object with a unique ID 
and default values (like zero likes and RSVPs), and then send that event to the shared context (useEvents) 
so it becomes part of the app’s event list. After submission, the form should either reset or navigate the user 
to the new event’s detail page.*/
