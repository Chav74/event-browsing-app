/* This component is used to display a list of events in the event browsing app.
This page should display the full list of events in the app. It should take the event data 
from the shared context and render each event as a card or row, usually by mapping over the events 
array and passing each item into the EventItem component. The list should update automatically whenever new 
events are added, removed, or updated. If there are no events, the page should show a simple message 
like “No events found.”*/
