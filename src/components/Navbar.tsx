/* This component is the navigation bar at the top of every page for the event browsing app.
This page should provide the navigation bar that appears at the top of the app. It should include links to the 
main sections such as the event list, the create event page, and any other key routes. 
The navbar should stay consistent across all pages, give users an easy way to move around the app, and 
clearly indicate which page they are on.*/
