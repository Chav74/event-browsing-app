/* This component is a search bar used to filter events in the event browsing app.
This page should provide a search input where users can type keywords to quickly filter through 
the list of events. As the user types, the search bar should update the displayed events in real 
time by matching against fields such as the event title, description, or location. It serves as a fast 
way to find specific events without needing to use the full set of filters.*/
